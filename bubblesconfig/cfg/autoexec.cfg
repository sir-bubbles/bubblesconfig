// Orignally based on Felik's config, since editted and warped with additions and configs I wrote and other configs from others I added in (Because they're damn good),
// including configs from Mastercom's config, Comanglia's configs, and a few others. (Credit found with corresponding exec below.)
// For the first year of playing competitive TF2, I was still playing on my extremely underpowered and not built for gaming laptop, which led to me trying to improve my performance 
// and learning all about scripting and tf2's cvars and all sorts of stuff. I'm not going to claim this config is some new amazing thing that will make your game run super fast - there are
// undoubtedly others who have done that better . This started as a pet project of just streamlining my own config, and got large enough to the point of making a github page for it to document changes
// and supply a download link if anyone wants to use it.

// The main goal here is simplicity and thus ease of use. Most configs I've seen are either very vague such as the original pioneers Chris and Comanglia, where editting them is a pain without
// knowing the commands yourself, or are very extravagant and deep to the point of backtracking to where it's alienating to change, read, or edit without knowledge like original configs previously mentioned.





// How to enable/disable things in the config -
// // = Disabled
//    = Enabled

// Recommended launch options: -novid -nojoy -nosteamcontroller -noff -w MONITORWIDTH -h MONITORHEIGHT -softparticlesdefaultoff -reuse -dxlevel 98 
// Remove -dxlevel from launch options after first launch
// dxlevels - 81 (Max performance, but slowly losing support from devs, disables skins/flames and blocks you from playing competitive matchmaking), 90 (Faster, less pretty dx9), 95 (Standard), 98 (Possible performance boost based on your system)

// -novid : Removes startup logo/video.
// -nosteamcontroller : Disables Steam Controller settings.
// -softparticlesdefaultoff : Disables particle/sprite depth blending.
// -nojoy : Disables Joystick settings.
// -dxlevel : Sets DirectX level. 
// -reuse : Improves network performance.
// -noff : Disables controller rumbling.
// -w : Monitor width in pixels. Example - If you have a 1080p monitor, you'd want to set this to 1080.
// -h : Monitor height in pixels. Example - If you have a 1080p monitor, you'd want to set this to 1920.

// Optional Launch Options

// -r_emulate_gl : Emulates OpenGL. Possible/Probable FPS increase.
// -threads X : Number of CPU threads used by the game. Do not use if you are setting to less than 4. X = Number of threads.
// -console : Open console on startup.
// -high : Run TF2 with high priority. May increase/decrease performance based on your system.
// -disable_d3d9_hacks : Disables Source Engine hacks. May increase/decrease performance based on your system.
// -nouserclip : Uses software clipping instead of hardware user clip planes. May increase/decrease performance based on your system.



// This config is meant for modern computers only. If you are on a standard laptop, or office grade desktop without a GPU above a 1300 score on Passmark, it is not recommended to use this config. 
//NOTE - TF2 is a CPU bound game. Any graphics card above a 1300 score on Passmark will not improve your FPS.


// --- Configs ---

 exec optimization              // Optimizations from mastercoms
// exec ssd                     // For users who have their game installed on an SSD, should decrease stuttering and whatnot. 
 
// exec tastefulframes          //  Increasing framerate while not destroying the game's looks. Disables ragdolls, gibs, and shadows by default. Disables other details, and lowers the quality of others (such as props).
// exec fancymode               // Oh the lights, the pretty lights :O (High quality. Will produce reduced framerates.)
// exec maxperf                 // I wanna frag noobs, screw graphics! (Will make your game look horrible in exchange for performance. Disables pretty much everything you can think of without going into mods.)
// exec ultra                   // What's 60 fps, never heard of it.



// --- Visuals ---
// Overrides for above configs



// exec gibs            //  Enables gibs.

// exec ragdolls        //  Ragdolls. 

// exec mapeffects      //  Enables HDR, color correction, 3D skyboxes, and more detailed lighting/props.

// exec models          //  Higher quality models (More polygons - smoother models.)

// exec shaders         //  Enables higher quality shaders.

// exec shadows         //  Fancy shadows. 

// exec antialiasing    //  Anti Aliasing. Do not enable unless you have a competent graphics card.

// exec textures        //  High quality textures. 







//   --- Networking ---
// Networking options. It is recommended to look through "networking" and customize the settings for your own connection. 

 exec networking     //Networking from Mastercoms




//  --- Utility ---
// General quality of life improvements. (Optional, should not increase/decrease performance)

// exec xray             //  Disables the teammate wallhack enabled on spawn.

// exec antivirus        // Stops naughty servers from touching your configs/bindings. (Made by Casual)

// exec scoreboard       // Shows net_graph 4 info on your screen along with the scoreboard when pressing Tab, network performance, FPS, etc. (Made by Woolen Sleevelet)

// exec custom           // Your custom commands/settings. Binds, mouse sens, things like that.
