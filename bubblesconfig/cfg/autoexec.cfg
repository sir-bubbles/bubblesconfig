//Maimed Config
//Base: Felik's Config
//Additions from: Bubbles, Mastercoms, Chris' Configs, Cowmanglia's Configs, Woolen Sleevelet





// How to enable/disable things in the config -
// // = Disabled
//    = Enabled

// Recommended launch options: -novid -nojoy -nosteamcontroller -noff -w MONITORWIDTH -h MONITORHEIGHT -softparticlesdefaultoff -reuse -dxlevel 98 
// Remove -dxlevel from launch options after first launch
// dxlevels - 81 (Max performance, but slowly losing support from devs, disables skins/flames and blocks you from playing competitive matchmaking), 90 (Faster, less pretty dx9), 95 (Standard), 98 (Possible performance boost based on your system)

// -novid : Removes startup logo/video.
// -nosteamcontroller : Disables Steam Controller settings.
// -softparticlesdefaultoff : Disables particle/sprite depth blending.
// -nojoy : Disables Joystick settings.
// -dxlevel : Sets DirectX level. 
// -reuse : Improves network performance.
// -noff : Disables controller rumbling.
// -w : Monitor width in pixels. Example - If you have a 1080p monitor, you'd want to set this to 1080.
// -h : Monitor height in pixels. Example - If you have a 1080p monitor, you'd want to set this to 1920.

// Optional Launch Options

// -r_emulate_gl : Emulates OpenGL. Possible/Probable FPS increase.
// -threads X : Number of CPU threads used by the game. Do not use if you are setting to less than 4. X = Number of threads.
// -console : Open console on startup.
// -high : Run TF2 with high priority. May increase/decrease performance based on your system.
// -disable_d3d9_hacks : Disables Source Engine hacks. May increase/decrease performance based on your system.
// -nouserclip : Uses software clipping instead of hardware user clip planes. May increase/decrease performance based on your system.



// Keep in mind that your GPU will never impact performance if you have a nVidia GTX 275/Radeon HD 4890 or above, entirely CPU dependent beyond that point, this is considering that you aren't using a 3840x2160 or above monitor.

// This config is meant for modern computers only. If you are on a standard laptop, or office grade desktop without a GPU above a 1300 score on Passmark, it is not recommended to use this config.
