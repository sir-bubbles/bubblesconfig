# bubblesconfig
Side project, attempting to make a simple, modular config for TF2, and keeping it as close to the vanilla game graphics as possible while still giving a performance boost.
The purpose of this Github page is mostly to keep track of any changes.

Based on heavily editted versions of Mastercom's, Felik's, Chris', and Comanglia's configs.

Not meant for underpowered PCs.
