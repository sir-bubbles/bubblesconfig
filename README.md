# bubblesconfig
Side project, attempting to make a simple, modular config for TF2, and keeping it as close to the vanilla game graphics as possible while still giving a performance boost.

Based on heavily editted versions of Mastercom's, Felik's, Chris', and Comanglia's configs.

Not meant for underpowered PCs.
